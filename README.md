# 🏏 IPL Winner Prediction System

## 📌 Overview  
The **IPL Winner Prediction System** is a machine learning project that predicts the winner of an IPL match based on previous years' data. The project utilizes Python and various data analysis techniques to train a model and make predictions.

## 🚀 Features  
- 📊 Data-driven approach using past IPL match records  
- 🤖 Machine Learning model for predictive analysis  
- 📈 Visualization of key insights and statistics  
- 🔍 Predicts match winners based on input parameters  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression / Random Forest (whichever you use)  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains past IPL match records, including team performances, venues, and match outcomes. The data is preprocessed and used for training the model.  

## 🎯 How It Works  
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Import historical IPL match data.  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful features such as team performance, venue impact, toss results, etc.  
3. **Model Training:** Train the machine learning model using Scikit-learn.  
4. **Prediction:** Input new match details to predict the winner.  
5. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using accuracy metrics.  

## 🔧 Installation & Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IPL-Winner-Prediction.git
